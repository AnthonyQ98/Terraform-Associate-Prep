terraform init = Initialize the project and download providers/modules specified in tf file
terraform fmt = It is similar to golang 'go fmt' command. It will format your terraform code to the standard expected.
terraform validate = It will ensure your terraform file has the required arguements/values
terraform plan = Generates a plan to show what our terraform code would create/destroy (aka: doesn't create infrastructure, just shows what would be created)
    - we can use -out="" to save the plan
    - we can use -var=*variable_name*=*variable value* 
terraform apply - It will show our plan again, and ask for confirmation if we want to actually APPLY/USE the plan (aka: create the infrastructure)
    - can use the -auto-approve flag to skip the confirmation stage.


Locals vs Variables:
    - Locals are generally hardcoded/set values that are not expected to change.
    - Variables will usually change (but not always)
    - You can format your strings using ${local.*variable name*}, example: favourite_name = "my_favourite_name_is_${local.name}", assuming there is a local 'name' value.
